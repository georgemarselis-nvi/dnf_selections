# dnf_selections
DNF plugin that works like dpkg --get-selections/--set-selections

Works with DNF5 and above.

There is a non-GPL version of this that works for previous versions of DNF and especially with Python 2 (Think Centos 5/6/7). If you are a business and need to replicate your packages from an older host, drop me a line.
